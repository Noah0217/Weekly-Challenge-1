# Horiseon Website

The webpage already had alot of work done to it already I went in and added alt text for the images used in the website and cleaned up the code so you can read what parts are what. Most websites skip out on the accessibility part of it but its important that you include those type of thigs in your code because you never know who is accessing your website.
